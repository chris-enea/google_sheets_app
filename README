Project Management Dashboard PRD
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the specifications for a Project Management Dashboard web application. The application will serve as a centralized hub for tracking and visualizing projects, with data integration from Asana.
1.2 Product Overview
The Project Management Dashboard is a web-based application that provides a visual interface for monitoring multiple projects simultaneously. It displays project information in a card-based layout and offers Gantt chart visualization capabilities both for individual projects and across all projects. The application integrates with Asana through its API to import tasks and timeline data.
1.3 Scope
The application will focus on providing a high-level view of projects and their timelines, rather than detailed task management which will be handled in Asana. It will serve as a visualization and monitoring tool, not a replacement for Asana's full project management capabilities.
2. User Requirements
2.1 User Personas

Project Managers: Need to track multiple projects and their timelines simultaneously
Team Leads: Need to view project progress and timelines for their specific projects
Executives: Need high-level overview of all projects and their statuses

2.2 User Stories

As a user, I want to see all projects displayed as cards on a dashboard so I can quickly scan their basic information
As a user, I want to view detailed information about a specific project when I select it
As a user, I want to visualize a project's timeline using a Gantt chart
As a user, I want to see a consolidated Gantt chart of all projects to understand dependencies and overlaps
As a user, I want to add new projects to the dashboard
As a user, I want to securely connect my Asana account to import project data

3. Feature Requirements
3.1 Dashboard Interface

Project Cards Display:

Each project represented as a card on the main dashboard
Cards show project name prominently
Each card has two action buttons: "View Details" and "View Gantt"
Visual indicators for project status (e.g., on track, delayed, completed)
Optional: Basic progress metrics on the card (% complete, days remaining)


Add New Project Functionality:

Prominent "Add Project" button on the dashboard
Clicking opens a form to enter project details
Option to associate with an existing Asana project or create new
